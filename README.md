# pradformat (Proton Radiography File Format Tools)

**pradformat** is a set of cross-platform tools related to particle radiography. It especially leans on reading and writing from a set of common HDF5 file formats (with common contents) for data at various stages along the real/synthetic particle radiography pipeline.

The Python code, MATLAB code, and shared HDF5 file structures of this package were written by Scott Feister of California State University Channel Islands for broader use by the High Energy Density Physics Community.
